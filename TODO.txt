NOW
- Ensure the event is pushed
- Serialize and Deserialize events (to JSON)
  = Shorthand naming for deserialization (e.g. unique event name)
  = Ensuring all events are also available for deserialization (store list of events, verify existence on startup)



FURTHER DOWN
- Separate Repository Functionality from IEventStore (e.g. create IAggregateRepository: it's implementation can also use snapshots to quickly (re)build an aggregate)
- Include version number in events
- Query and Persist events ((1)from version, (2) until version)
- Create Snapshots
